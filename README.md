# SparkDensityTree

This project aims to develop a nonparamteric density estimator with universal performance guarantees using distributed sparse binary trees.

Original ideas from [Data Adaptive Histograms for Statistical Regular Pavings](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20161121optMAPMDE.pdf) 
have been extended into the distributed fault-tolerant setting provided by Apache Spark.
